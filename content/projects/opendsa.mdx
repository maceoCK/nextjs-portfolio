As a contributor to the OpenDSA project at Virginia Tech, I was part of a team working towards creating open-source courseware for Data Structures and Algorithms courses. Our goal was to deeply integrate textbook-quality content with algorithm visualizations and interactive, automatically assessed exercises. My contributions helped enhance the learning experience for students by making complex algorithms more accessible and engaging.
